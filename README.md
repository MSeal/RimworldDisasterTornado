![Alt text](About/Preview.png?raw=true "Disasters: Tornado")

Adds tornados back to RimWorld. Crop-ripping, geothermal-lifting, loot-destroying winds can soon visit your quaint fishing village.

## Changes
- Brings back tornados
- Disaster options in Mod Settings

## Description

Adds B18 tornadoes back for those that enjoyed the natual disaster. This doesn't modify the behavior of tornadoes in anyway -- the tornado generator and the mod use the same tornado class.

For a more silly version of tornadoes take a look at [Sharknado](https://github.com/MSeal/RimworldSharknado).

## Required Mods
- Hugs Lib

## Compatibility
Should be compatible with just about everything.

- Works with [Sharknado](https://github.com/MSeal/RimworldSharknado) if you want both ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## Current (Sometimes Crude) Translations

Based on what was there in B18 (coverage varies) with a couple fixes

- English
- Catalan
- French
- Italian
- German
- Japanese
- Korean
- Chinese (Simplified)
- Hungarian
- Russian
- Spanish

Link me translation fixes/additions and I'll add them in.
