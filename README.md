![Alt text](About/Preview.png?raw=true "Disasters: Tornado")

Adds tornados back to RimWorld. Crop-ripping, geothermal-lifting, loot-destroying winds can soon visit your quaint fishing village.

## Changes
- Brings back tornados
- Makes tornados dissipate when over thick roofs (mountain tiles)
- Disaster options in Mod Settings

## Description

Adds B18 tornadoes back for those that enjoyed the natual disaster. This doesn't modify the behavior of tornadoes except to make them unable to sustain above mountain roofs. The tornado generator and the mod use the same tornado class.

For a more silly version of tornadoes take a look at [Sharknado](https://github.com/MSeal/RimworldSharknado).

## Required Mods
- Harmony
- Hugs Lib

## Compatibility
Should be compatible with just about everything.

- Works with [Sharknado](https://github.com/MSeal/RimworldSharknado) if you want both ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## Current (Sometimes Crude) Translations

Link me translation fixes/additions and I'll add them in.
