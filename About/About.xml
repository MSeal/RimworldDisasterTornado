    <description>[h1][B19] Disasters: Tornado[/h1]
Crop-ripping, geothermal-lifting, loot-destroying winds can soon visit your quaint fishing village.

[h1]Changes[/h1]
- Brings back tornados
- Disaster options in Mod Settings


[h1]Description[/h1]

Adds B18 tornadoes back for those that enjoyed the natual disaster. This doesn't modify the behavior of tornadoes in anyway -- the tornado generator and the mod use the same tornado class.

For a more silly version of tornadoes take a look at [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1502928982]Sharknado[/url].


[h1]Required Mods[/h1]
- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=818773962]Hugs Lib[/url]


[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
Should be compatible with just about everything.

- Works with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1502928982]Sharknado[/url] if you want both ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[h1]Current (Sometimes Crude) Translations[/h1]
Based on what was there in B18 (coverage varies) with a couple fixes
- English
- Catalan
- French
- Italian
- German
- Japanese
- Korean
- Chinese (Simplified)
- Hungarian
- Russian
- Spanish

Link me translation fixes/additions and I'll add them in.
