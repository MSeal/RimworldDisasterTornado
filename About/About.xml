    <description>[h1][1.0] Disasters: Tornado[/h1]
Crop-ripping, geothermal-lifting, loot-destroying winds can soon visit your quaint fishing village.

[h1]Changes[/h1]
- Brings back tornados
- Makes tornados dissipate when over thick roofs (mountain tiles)
- Disaster options in Mod Settings


[h1]Description[/h1]

Adds B18 tornadoes back for those that enjoyed the natual disaster. This doesn't modify the behavior of tornadoes except to make them unable to sustain above mountain roofs. The tornado generator and the mod use the same tornado class.

For a more silly version of tornadoes take a look at [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1502928982]Sharknado[/url].


[h1]Required Mods[/h1]
- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=818773962]Hugs Lib[/url]


[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
Should be compatible with just about everything.

- Works with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1502928982]Sharknado[/url] if you want both ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

- English

- Française

- Deutsche
- 中文
- 한국어

Link me translation fixes/additions and I'll add them in.
